This was slightly below the previous estimates but in line with the consensus outlook. In our estimation, this will be the last time for a long time that the country experiences GDP growth in the 7.0% range. The 4Q period was post-Delta and pre-Omicron. In addition, since the end of the fourth quarter, Russia has invaded Ukraine and the Federal Reserve has started to raise short-term interest rates. These factors, as well as the inevitable emergence of new COVID strains, are likely to send GDP growth back down to the pre-pandemic level of 2.0%-3.0%. The GDP report also includes an inflation gauge, the PCE price index.

After this reading, we expect that GDP reports going forward should settle into a low- to mid-single-digits rate. But there is still work to be done. At $21.2 trillion, the U.S. economy at the end of 3Q was almost 3% below its pre-pandemic highs. Some segments of the economy are back to or above pre-pandemic highs.

In January, BlackRock CEO Lawrence Fink, who oversees approximately $7 trillion in assets, announced that his firm would be investing in companies that are making progress on sustainability. Mr. Fink's new focus follows rapid growth in sustainable assets in recent years. According to Opimas, a management consultancy focused on global capital markets, global assets under management in ESG strategies had grown to $40.5 trillion in 2020, doubling in four years and tripling in eight years. There were almost 400 ESG strategies launched in the Morningstar investment universe in 2019, compared with around 160 launches in 2016.  The UN Principles for Responsible Investing -- to which Argus Research is a signatory -- now represents more than 1,750 signatories with assets of US $80 trillion, according to Barron's. As assets have flowed in, SRI investing has evolved over the past 40 years.  Now, instead of merely identifying industries to avoid, the discipline promotes \\\"sustainable\\\" business practices across all businesses that can have an \\\"impact\\\" on global issues such as workers' rights, poverty, hunger and the climate. Based on numerous requests from clients, we have compiled a list of companies followed by Argus Research that are in position to have this type of \\\"sustainable impact\\\" on the environment, workplace and community.  These firms have exemplary records not only in delivering on the bottom line, but also in improving the environment, contributing to community relations, and showing respect for their employees. We derived our list by identifying companies that are either BUY-rated or HOLD-rated by Argus analysts, and also score highly on ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) criteria established by the JUST Capital Foundation. JUST Capital utilizes a combination of polling, data-driven research, and strategic engagement to shift behaviors and activities in corporate America and the financial markets. JUST Capital's mission is to drive measurable corporate change to create a stakeholder-centric, inclusive form of capitalism that reflects the priorities of the American public.  JUST ranks the Russell 1000 on these criteria against a scale of 1-100. Here are the companies in the Argus Universe that score highest on the scale.

The United States economy is full of innovation. It has to be. Manufacturing industries that dominated the economy decades ago - textiles, televisions, even automobiles, to a large degree - have moved overseas, where costs are lower. Yet the U.S. economy, prior to the pandemic, had expanded to record levels. And now the U.S. Healthcare industry is mobilizing to improve COVID-19 testing, treatments and, ultimately, a vaccine. If U.S. corporations weren't innovating, creating new products and services and moving into new markets and applications, the domestic economy would not have recently completed a 10-year expansion phase before the coronavirus hit, and capital would not be flooding into the country. A couple of statistics should help illustrate our point. Consider that U.S. GDP was approximately $1 trillion in 1930 but nearly $22 trillion in 2019. That's growth of 22-times.

The United States economy is full of innovation. It has to be. Manufacturing industries that dominated the economy decades ago - textiles, televisions, even automobiles, to a large degree - have moved overseas, where costs are lower. Yet the U.S. economy, prior to the pandemic, had expanded to record levels. And now the U.S. Healthcare industry is mobilizing to improve COVID-19 testing, treatments and, ultimately, a vaccine. If U.S. corporations weren't innovating, creating new products and services and moving into new markets and applications, the domestic economy would not have recently completed a 10-year expansion phase before the coronavirus hit, and capital would not be flooding into the country. A couple of statistics should help illustrate our point. Consider that U.S. GDP was approximately $1 trillion in 1930 but nearly $22 trillion in 2019. That's growth of 22-times. Meanwhile, the U.S. population has grown less than 3-times during that time span, to 320 million from 120 million. The delta between GDP growth and population growth has been driven in large part by innovation.

In January 2020, BlackRock CEO Lawrence Fink, who oversees approximately $9 trillion in assets, announced that his firm would be investing in companies that are making progress on sustainability. He doubled down in his January 2021 letter, calling on company managements to disclose their plans for making their businesses \"compatible with a net-zero economy\" by 2050. As assets have flowed in over the past 40 years, Sustainable Impact Investing has evolved. The discipline, originally known as Socially Responsible Investing, focused at first on excluding companies that conducted business in South Africa, or participated in industries such as tobacco, alcohol, and firearms. But the performance of these initial strategies lagged, and the approach has been modified. Now, instead of merely identifying industries to avoid, the discipline promotes \"sustainable\" business practices across all industries that can have an \"impact\" on global issues such as the climate, hunger, poverty, disease, shelter, and workers\\' rights.'], ['Apple manufactures smartphones, tablets, P6Cs, software and peripherals for a worldwide customer base.

Manufacturing industries that dominated the economy decades ago - textiles, televisions, even automobiles to a large degree - have moved overseas, where costs are lower. Yet the U.S. economy, even during the pandemic, has expanded to record levels. If U.S. corporations weren't innovating, the domestic economy would not be growing and capital would not be flooding into the country. Consider that U.S. GDP was approximately $1 trillion in 1930 but nearly $23 trillion at the end of 1H21. That's growth of 23-times. Meanwhile, the U.S. population has grown less than three-times during that time span, to 320 million from 120 million. The delta between GDP growth and population growth has been driven, in large part, by innovation. In addition, the value of listed corporations on U.S. stock exchanges at the end of 2020 was approximately $41 trillion, according to SIFMA, representing 38% of global equity market capitalization, while U.S. GDP represented only 26% of global GDP.

While the absolute number of jobs gained was well under expectations, some economists believe the seasonal adjustment (related to limited return to classrooms in fall 2020) may have skewed the data, and that without adjustments the job tally would have been higher.'], [\"The U.S. Department of Commerce announced that its third estimate for 2Q21 GDP growth was a rate of 6.7%.

The sector is the largest in the U.S. market and now accounts for more than 28% of the S&P 500. Over the long term, we expect the sector to benefit from pervasive digitization across the economy, greater acceptance of transformative technologies, and the development of the Internet of Things (IoT).
